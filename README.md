# Semi-supervised learning of a non-native phonetic contrast

## Introduction

This project archives the results for the following, in-press publication (as
of 2019).

Wright, B., LeBlanc, E., Little, D. F., Conderman, J., Glavin, C.,
Semi-supervised learning of a non-native phonetic contrast: How much feedback
is enough? Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics.

### Abstract

Semi-supervised learning refers to learning that occurs when feedback about
performance is provided on only a subset of training trials. Algorithms for
semi-supervised learning are popular in machine learning because of their
minimal reliance on labeled data. There are, however, only a few reports of
semi-supervised learning in humans. Here we document human semi-supervised
learning on a non-native phonetic classification task. Classification
performance remained unchanged when 60 feedback trials were provided on each
of the two days of training. In contrast, performance improved when 60
feedback trials were combined with 240 no-feedback trials each day. In
variants of this successful semi-supervised regimen, increasing the daily
number of feedback trials from 60 to 240 did not increase the amount of
learning, while decreasing that number to 30 abolished learning. Finally,
replacing the no-feedback trials with stimulus exposure alone had little
effect on the outcome. These results were an unexpected consequence of
combining training periods with feedback and testing periods without
feedback, illustrating that no-feedback testing can influence learning
outcomes. More broadly, these data suggest that task performance with
feedback can function as an all-or-none trigger for recruiting the
contribution of trials without feedback, or mere stimulus exposures, to human
learning.

## Installation

### Python Installation

Once you have downloaded this project, to setup the development environment you
will need to install [Anaconda Python 2.7](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).
Then, run the following commands on the command line (replacing `[project
directory]` with the location of the folder containing the downloaded project).

```sh
cd [project directory]
conda env create -f environment.yml
source activate apamount
```

> In windows these command can be run on the command line that is 
> installed with Anaconda. You will also need to replace the last line
> as follows.

```sh
activate apamount
```

This setup will take some time to run on your machine as various python
packages are installed.

#### Mac OS X - Make sure you have command-line developer tools installed

On Mac OS X, if you plan to re-run any of the python scripts, you will need
to make sure you have the [command-line developer tools
installed](http://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/).
The python code employes `pystan` which requires a C++ compile to be
available on your machine.


### R Installation

You will first need to install [R](https://www.r-project.org/). You'll have
to select a specific mirror (any one of them will do). Then open the R
terminal and enter the following command.

```R
install.packages(c('ggplot2','Hmisc'))
```

## Usage

All of the below scripts require facility with the python and R langauges,
and good programming environment. To use the python packages you will need,
first activate the conda environment as follows.

```sh
cd [project directory]
source activate apamount
```

> Again, in Windows these command can be run on the command line that is 
> installed with Anaconda and you will need to replace the last line
> with `activate apamount` (no `source`).

Each of the three figures from the manuscript have a corresponding figure
(created in R) and anlaysis (run in python). The names of the figures are as
as follows:

* Figure 1 --- `apamount_amount_[DATE].pdf`
* Figure 2 --- `apamount_amount_byday_[DATE].pdf`
* Figure 3 --- `apamount_amount_passive_[Date].pdf`

## Creating the plots

The figures are created using the following R scripts:

* `amount.R` --- Creates Figure 1 & 2
* `passive.R` --- Creates Figure 3

## Running the analysis

The analysis output can be re-generated by running the following python scripts:

* `amount.py` --- Creates Figure 1 & 2 analyses
* `passive.py` --- Creates Figure 3 analyses

### Comparison to Published Figures and Statistics

The resulting pdfs from the scripts were imported into Adobe Illustrator and
the aesthetics modified for improved legibility and consistency across plots.
Thus the published figures will differ somewhat from those produced by these
scripts: however, the actual data and reported statistics as represented in the
final paper should remain *unchanged*. Small variations in model fits and the
resulting statistics will occur due variations in  MCMC sampling.  

## Editing Scripts

To edit the scripts you can use a language specific editor:

* For R - [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)
* For python - [Spyder](https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/index.html)

You can also use any decent code editor to edit both file types (listed in
approximate order from fastest to slowest to learn).

* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
* [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
* [Vim](http://www.vim.org/)

These generic editors sometimes require you to install specific plugins to read
R and python files.

## Feedback/Help
